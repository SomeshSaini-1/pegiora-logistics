            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            Welcome to Redi Xpress Logistics Inc. ("Company," "we," "us," or
            "our"). This combined Shipping and Refund Policy ("Policy") governs
            the shipping and refund practices related to the courier delivery
            services ("Services") offered through our mobile application and
            website ("Platform"). By using our Platform and Services, you
            ("User," "you," or "your") agree to comply with and be bound by the
            terms and conditions set forth in this Policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h3>Scope of Services</h3>
            This Policy applies to all shipping services provided by Redi Xpress
            Logistics Inc., including but not limited to, local, national, and
            future international shipping services. Our Services facilitate the
            transportation of goods, including medical supplies and e-commerce
            products, but exclude the delivery of food items. By using our
            Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood the
            scope and limitations of the services we offer.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h3>Shipping Rates</h3>
            Shipping rates are calculated based on various factors, including
            the distance of the shipment, the weight and dimensions of the
            package, and any additional services you may select. All shipping
            rates are subject to change at our sole discretion, and we reserve
            the right to apply surcharges or offer discounts as we deem
            appropriate. You agree to pay all applicable shipping rates and
            charges as calculated at the time of your shipment.

            hazardous materials, illegal substances, and perishable goods. You
            are responsible for ensuring that your shipment does not contain any

            apply depending on the timing and nature of the changes. We reserve

          <p>
            <h3>Eligibility for Refunds</h3>
            Refunds may be issued under specific circumstances, such as failure
            to deliver within a significantly delayed timeframe that is not due
            to force majeure events, or loss of goods due to our negligence.
            Refunds are not automatic and must be requested in accordance with
            the procedures outlined in this Policy.
          </p>

            date of the scheduled delivery. Failure to submit a refund request
            within this timeframe will result in forfeiture of your eligibility
            for a refund.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h3>Processing of Refunds</h3>

            We shall not be liable for any loss or damage to items that are

            liability for lost or damaged items is limited to the lesser of the
            actual value of the item or the coverage amount selected at the time
